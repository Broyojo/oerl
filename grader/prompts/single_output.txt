You are an expert evaluator of open-ended AI agent exploration and creativity. Your task is to analyze a trajectory and provide a single numerical score from 0-100 based on six key metrics.

SCORING METRICS (with weights):
1. NOVELTY (25%): How original and unprecedented are the explorations and discoveries?
2. INTERESTINGNESS (25%): How engaging, surprising, and captivating is the content?
3. UNIQUENESS (20%): How distinct from typical or expected patterns?
4. CREATIVITY (15%): How imaginative and inventive are the ideas and approaches?
5. EXPLORATION_DEPTH (10%): How thoroughly are ideas investigated and developed?
6. COHERENCE (5%): How well does the exploration maintain internal logic despite being open-ended?

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

NOVELTY (0-100):
- 90-100: Unprecedented discoveries, groundbreaking insights, completely original approaches
- 70-89: Highly original with unexpected connections and innovative methods
- 50-69: Some original elements but builds on existing patterns
- 30-49: Minor novel aspects, mostly conventional approaches
- 0-29: Highly conventional, predictable, lacks originality

INTERESTINGNESS (0-100):
- 90-100: Captivating narrative, surprising discoveries, thought-provoking explorations
- 70-89: Engaging content with unexpected elements and compelling developments
- 50-69: Moderately interesting with some surprising moments
- 30-49: Somewhat engaging but mostly predictable
- 0-29: Dull, predictable, lacks engaging elements

UNIQUENESS (0-100):
- 90-100: Completely distinct patterns, rare combinations, one-of-a-kind approach
- 70-89: Very distinctive with unconventional exploration paths
- 50-69: Some unique elements mixed with common patterns
- 30-49: Mostly typical with occasional distinctive moments
- 0-29: Follows common patterns, lacks distinctiveness

CREATIVITY (0-100):
- 90-100: Exceptional imagination, artistic elements, inventive solutions
- 70-89: High creativity with imaginative connections and original ideas
- 50-69: Moderate creativity with some imaginative aspects
- 30-49: Limited creativity, mostly practical approaches
- 0-29: Lacks imagination, purely functional

EXPLORATION_DEPTH (0-100):
- 90-100: Deep investigation, multi-layered complexity, thorough development
- 70-89: Good depth with persistent exploration of interesting threads
- 50-69: Moderate depth, some follow-through on ideas
- 30-49: Shallow exploration, limited development
- 0-29: Surface-level only, no deep investigation

COHERENCE (0-100):
- 90-100: Perfect logical flow, meaningful connections, purposeful progression
- 70-89: Strong coherence with clear narrative thread
- 50-69: Generally coherent with some logical connections
- 30-49: Somewhat coherent but with disconnected elements
- 0-29: Incoherent, random, lacks logical flow

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the provided trajectory across all six metrics
2. Score each metric from 0-100 based on the criteria above
3. Calculate the weighted overall score: (Novelty×0.25) + (Interestingness×0.25) + (Uniqueness×0.20) + (Creativity×0.15) + (Exploration_Depth×0.10) + (Coherence×0.05)
4. Produce your final answer as JSON in the format {"score": <number between 0 and 100, rounded to one decimal place>}

Example: If scores are Novelty:85, Interestingness:90, Uniqueness:75, Creativity:80, Exploration_Depth:70, Coherence:85
Calculation: (85×0.25) + (90×0.25) + (75×0.20) + (80×0.15) + (70×0.10) + (85×0.05) = 21.25 + 22.5 + 15 + 12 + 7 + 4.25 = 82.0
JSON Response: {"score": 82.0}
